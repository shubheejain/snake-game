# snake-game
Project Prerequisites
To build the snake game project we used the turtle module, random module, time module, and concept of python.

Turtle module gives us a feature to draw on a drawing board

Random module will be used to generate random numbers

Time module is an inbuilt module in python. It provides the functionality of time.

To install python modules we use the pip install command in the command line:

pip install turtles
pip install random
